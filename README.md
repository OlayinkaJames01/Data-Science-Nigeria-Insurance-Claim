# Data-Science-Nigeria-Insurance-Claim

A machining learning problem which involves building a predictive model that can provide the total amount of claim by a customer in seconds

## The dataset contains these variables as explained below:

## Evalutation 

Root Mean Squared Error or RMSE is the standard deviation of the errors which occur when a prediction is made on a dataset. This is the same as MSE Mean Squared Error but the root of the value is considered while determining the predictive performance of the model.
